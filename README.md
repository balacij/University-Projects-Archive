# University Projects Archive

1.   Most of the projects required us to comment each line of code.
2.   Do not copy and paste the projects.  You would be failing yourself and be committing academic dishonesty.
3.   If you worked on a project with me and your name is listed at the top of a particular source file, please message me and I     will add a link to your GitHub page to the bottom of this readme file.
